        <h1>AI for Drug Discovery: A Journey into Machine Learning & Pharma</h1>
        <p>The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a transformation, with AI-powered drug discovery at the forefront. Companies like DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, and GSK are leveraging machine learning to accelerate drug design, reduce costs, and uncover novel therapeutics.</p>

        <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
        <p>The goal of this blog is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bridge the gap between life sciences and AI.</li>
            <li>Provide step-by-step tutorials on real-world drug discovery projects.</li>
            <li>Build an industry-relevant portfolio for AI-driven biotech roles.</li>
            <li>Showcase how machine learning can revolutionize drug discovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each project will be hands-on, with code, datasets, and implementation details that you can follow along with.</p>

        <h2>Project Focus: AI for Drug and Biologics Design</h2>
        <p>The first project will explore AI-driven drug and biologics design, focusing on small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. The goal is to predict drug-protein interactions and optimize biologics for therapeutic use.</p>

        <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Small molecules are the foundation of most drug therapies, but discovering effective ones is time-consuming and expensive.</li>
            <li>Peptides & biologics (such as antibodies) are increasingly important in modern medicine due to their high specificity and reduced side effects.</li>
            <li>AI-driven modeling can predict interactions, generate novel candidates, and optimize molecular designs much faster than traditional methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools & Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>DeepChem – AI-driven molecular modeling.</li>
            <li>AlphaFold – Predicting protein structures.</li>
            <li>RDKit & AutoDock Vina – Molecular docking simulations.</li>
            <li>ProteinMPNN & DiffDock – Peptide and protein-ligand interaction modeling.</li>
            <li>Google Colab – Free cloud computing for running ML models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goals & Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Week 1-2: Understanding molecular representations & AI models.</li>
            <li>Week 3-4: Predicting drug-protein binding affinities with ML.</li>
            <li>Week 5-6: Designing AI-generated peptide therapeutics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project will result in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A trained AI model for small molecule binding prediction.</li>
            <li>A pipeline for generating novel peptide binders.</li>
            <li>A step-by-step tutorial & GitHub repository for others to follow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>
        <p>This first project will set the foundation for three additional AI-driven drug discovery projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ML for Multi-Omics Target Discovery – Identifying novel drug targets from large omics datasets.</li>
            <li>Generative AI for De Novo Drug Design – AI-generated molecules optimized for drug-like properties.</li>
            <li>AI-Driven Screening & Optimization – Refining candidate drugs with computational methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>The next blog post will cover the setup for AI-driven drug and biologics design, including software installation and dataset selection. Stay tuned!</p>
