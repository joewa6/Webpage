        <h2>Welcome to My Projects Showcase</h2>
        <p><em>Published on: <span class="post-date">2024-01-01</span></em></p>

        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Joe Wallace, and I'm a postdoctoral researcher in computational chemistry. I've created this website as a platform to document and share my work, experiences, and the various projects I've been involved in over the years.</p>

        <h3>Why This Webpage?</h3>
        <p>As someone deeply involved in computational chemistry, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of interesting projects, each offering unique challenges and learning experiences. This website serves as a space where I can not only document these projects for my own records but also share them with fellow researchers, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in the field.</p>

        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <p>In the <strong>Projects</strong> section, you'll find detailed descriptions of the various research and development projects I've worked on. These posts will cover a range of topics, from fundamental research in computational methods to applied projects in drug discovery and material science.</p>

        <p>Each project post will provide an overview of the problem I set out to solve, the methodologies employed, the results obtained, and the implications of these results. My aim is to present this information in a way that's accessible to both specialists in the field and those who might be newer to these topics.</p>

        <h3>Stay Connected</h3>
        <p>I plan to regularly update this site with new projects, findings, and insights. If you're interested in staying up-to-date with my work, feel free to check back periodically or connect with me through the contact information provided on this site.</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content here both informative and inspiring!</p>
